v1.0: |
  <h3>First release after forking StreetComplete v26.2
  <p>This is the first version of AccessComplete, a fork of the awesome StreetComplete project. This fork was created to focus on quests that generate accessibility data on OSM. Therefore, most of the original StreetComplete quests have been removed in AccessComplete. In the future, a reporting mode for accessibility issues might be added which is another major reason for creating this fork.</p>
  <p>The following quest types have been added or reworked:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Added: Measuring the width of footway or cycleway parts, paths, and other pedestrian accessible ways (with the possibility to use the device's AR capabilities to determine the distance between two points)</li>
    <li>Added: Measuring the incline of pedestrian accessible paths and streets (with the possibility to use the device as a measurement instrument)</li>
    <li>Added: Determining the smoothness of footway parts, paths, and other pedestrian accessible ways</li>
    <li>Added: Determining the curb types of footway crossings</li>
    <li>Reworked: The surface quests now only apply to footway or cycleway parts, paths and pedestrian accessible streets</li>
  </ul>
