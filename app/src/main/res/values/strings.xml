&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direct Contributions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First off, understand that with this app, you make actual and direct contributions to the OpenStreetMap.&lt;br/&gt;
Anything you contribute in this app is directly added to the map, there is no third party in-between the app and OSM infrastructure, like it is the case with &lt;a href=\"https://wheelmap.org\"&gt;wheelmap.org&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http://www.kort.ch\"&gt;Kort&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Editing the OpenStreetMap anonymously is not possible, so any changes you make are made with your OSM user account. This means, that the date, content and implicitly the location of your changes are visible publicly on the openstreetmap website and are attributable to your account.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Location&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The app does not share your GPS location with anyone. It is used to automatically scan for quests around your area and to focus (and thus download) the map around your location.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data Usage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As mentioned, the app directly communicates with OSM infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;
However, before uploading your changes, the app checks with a &lt;a href=\"https://www.westnordost.de/streetcomplete/banned_versions.txt\"&gt;simple text file&lt;/a&gt; on my server whether it has been banned from uploading any changes. This is a precautionary measure to be able to keep versions of the app that turn out to have critical bugs from possibly corrupting OSM data.&lt;/p&gt;"</string>
    <string name="privacy_html_tileserver2">"&lt;p&gt;To display the map, vector tiles are retrieved from %1$s. See their &lt;a href=\"%2$s\"&gt;privacy statement&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;"</string>
    <string name="privacy_html_image_upload2">&lt;p&gt;Photos you attach to a note are uploaded to my server and deleted some days after that note has been resolved. Their meta-data is stripped before upload.&lt;/p&gt;</string>
    <string name="privacy_html_statistics">&lt;p&gt;The data shown in your profile is aggregated from your publicly available contribution history to OpenStreetMap and then hosted on my server.&lt;/p&gt;</string>
